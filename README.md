# AB-testing-for-E-commerce-applications

The project uses a dataset which tries to mimic an online e-commerce site. A dummy relational database has been used which consists of tables related to user information, product details, item viewing activity and order details. It is available at Mode, a free public data warehouse. 
The first part of the project will deal with data exploration that would include understanding the data, getting a clear understanding of various tables and how they ar erelated to one another,
The second part of the project would involve answering important data questions that arise at any e-commerce company by writing queries using SQL
The third part of the project would be dedicated to product analysis
the fourth part will end with AB testing where running some tests would help us decide if the change we are trying to introduce at our dummy company could yeild any statistically significant results
Below is a simple wireframe drawing of a website owned by a fictitious e-commerce company. We have some items which can be viewed and purchased via the users, in order to purchase an item a visitor must first create an account and be logged in and then add the item to their cart and then check out.
